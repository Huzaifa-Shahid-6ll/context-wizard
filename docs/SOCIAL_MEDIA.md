**Name:** Context Wizard

**Tagline:** Stop fighting AI coding tools with bad context. Generate perfect context files from any GitHub repo in 30 seconds.

**Description:**

As developers, we're all excited about the potential of AI coding assistants. But we've also all experienced the frustration of getting bad suggestions because the AI doesn't understand our codebase.

Context Wizard solves this problem by automatically generating a `.cursorrules` file from any GitHub repository. This file gives your AI coding assistant the context it needs to provide you with accurate, relevant, and helpful code suggestions.

With Context Wizard, you can:

*   Generate context files for any public or private GitHub repository.
*   Download a `.cursorrules` file that works with Cursor, Windsurf, and other popular AI coding tools.
*   Save time and frustration by giving your AI the context it needs to be a true assistant.

We're offering unlimited free generations during our launch week. Give it a try and let us know what you think!

I'm excited to announce the launch of Context Wizard!

As a developer, I've been amazed by the power of AI coding assistants. But I've also been frustrated by how often they get things wrong because they lack the proper context of my projects.

That's why I built Context Wizard. It's a simple tool that analyzes any GitHub repository and generates a `.cursorrules` file that you can use to give your AI coding assistant the context it needs to be truly helpful.

If you're a developer who uses AI coding tools, I'd love for you to give it a try. We're offering unlimited free generations during our launch week.

**Title:** I made a tool to stop fighting with my AI coding assistant

**Body:**

Hey everyone,

I love using AI coding assistants, but I was getting tired of them giving me bad suggestions because they didn't understand my codebase. I built a tool to fix this.

It's called Context Wizard, and it generates a `.cursorrules` file from any GitHub repo. You can use this file with tools like Cursor to give the AI the context it needs to be more helpful.

It supports public and private repos, and it's free to use. I'm looking for feedback, so I'd love for you to try it out and let me know what you think.
