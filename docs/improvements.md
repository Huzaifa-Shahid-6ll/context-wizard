# To-Do List

- [x] **Cross-Feature Standardization (forms):** Audit and refactor all forms (`generic-prompt`, `cursor-builder`, `image-prompt`, `video-prompt`) to consistently use the existing shared components (`ToneStyleSelector`, `OutputFormatSelector`, `AudienceSelector`, `TechnicalDetailsBuilder`, `ModeSelector`). Create and integrate any missing shared components like `ConstraintsInput` and `TechStackSelector`.
- [x] **Smart Auto-Fill Suggestions:** Replace the current `localStorage`-based implementation with the more robust, Convex-based `AutofillService` outlined in `src/lib/autofill.ts` to enable more advanced suggestion features.
- [x] **Accessibility:** Implement a theme toggle to allow users to switch to the existing high-contrast theme in `src/app/globals.css`. (Note: A full accessibility audit using a tool like Axe still needs to be conducted to identify and fix other issues.)
- [ ] **Tech Stack Detection:** Implement a dedicated "Review & Correct Tech Stack" step within the `cursor-builder` workflow to allow users to correct auto-detected technologies.
- [x] **Progressive Disclosure Modes:** Standardize the use of the `ModeSelector` component across all structured forms (`generic-prompt`, `cursor-builder`, `image-prompt`, `video-prompt`) to ensure a consistent user experience for "Quick," "Standard," and "Advanced" modes.
- [ ] **Analytics (PostHog):** Expand analytics coverage by adding PostHog tracking to all key events across all generator pages, not just `generic-prompt`.
- [ ] **Templates: Community v1:** Develop the community features for the template library, including a public listing page with search and filtering capabilities.
- [ ] **User Preferences & History (Convex):** Migrate all user preferences and history from `localStorage` to Convex. Create and use `useUserPreferences` and `useUserHistory` hooks to replace the current ad-hoc data fetching.
- [ ] **Rich Media Inputs:** Create a `FileUpload` component that supports drag-and-drop for rich media. Implement the backend infrastructure with an API route for S3 presigned URLs and update the Convex schema to store media references.
- [ ] **OpenRouter Rate Limit Handling:** Implement strategies to mitigate OpenRouter rate limits, including upgrading to a paid API tier, implementing server-side request queuing in Convex, exploring dynamic model routing, and enhancing client-side feedback for users.
