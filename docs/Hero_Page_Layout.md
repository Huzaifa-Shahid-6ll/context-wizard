Looking at your `page.tsx` file, I can see the sections are arranged in the following chronological order from top to bottom:

## Section Arrangement (Top to Bottom):

1. **Navbar** (line 198) - Navigation component at the top

2. **Hero Section** (lines 200-285) - Main landing area with:
   - Badge ("Free • No Credit Card • Instant Results")
   - Main headline ("Stop Fighting Cursor with Bad Context")
   - Subheadline
   - Two-column feature comparison (Without Context vs With Context)
   - URL input field and "Generate Context Files" button
   - Auth buttons (Sign up/Sign in)

3. **Testimonials Carousel** (lines 287-338) - "Loved by Developers Worldwide" section with rotating testimonials

4. **Use Cases Section** (lines 339-439) - "Built for Real Development Scenarios" with 4 use cases:
   - Onboarding New Developers
   - Better Code Reviews
